# Conclusion & Future Work

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated how machine learning can be applied to predict course popularity on Udemy. Using metadata such as titles, ratings, reviews, and price details, we built a predictive model with R² ≈ 0.67.  

The model captures key patterns in the data and provides a baseline for predicting the number of subscribers a new course may attract.

## Future Work
1. Experiment with advanced models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost for better accuracy.
2. Use deep learning models or embeddings (e.g., BERT) to capture richer semantic meaning from course titles.
3. Collect additional metadata such as instructor details, course duration, and promotional campaigns to improve prediction quality.
4. Build classification models (e.g., "popular" vs. "not popular") for easier decision-making.
5. Deploy the project as a cloud-hosted web app (Heroku, AWS, or GCP) for public access.
