# Problem Statement

With the rise of online education platforms like Udemy, predicting the popularity of courses has become an important task. Popularity, measured by the number of subscribers, depends on various factors such as course title, category, price, discount strategy, number of reviews, and ratings.  

However, it is not straightforward to estimate how many subscribers a new course might attract.  

This project aims to solve the problem by building a machine learning model that can predict the number of subscribers for a course using its metadata. This will help:
- Instructors optimize their course design and pricing strategy.
- Udemy identify potentially popular courses.
- Learners gain insights into which course attributes drive popularity.
