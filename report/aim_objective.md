# Aim & Objectives

## Aim
The aim of this project is to analyze Udemy’s Finance & Accounting course dataset and build a predictive machine learning model that estimates the expected number of subscribers for a course based on its characteristics such as title, category, price, discount, ratings, and reviews.

## Objectives
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand course trends and subscriber distribution.
2. Preprocess and clean the dataset (handle missing values, outliers, inconsistent values).
3. Engineer meaningful features from course metadata (e.g., title length, keyword flags, category mapping).
4. Build and train machine learning models to predict the number of subscribers.
5. Evaluate models using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R².
6. Deploy the trained model as:
   - A Flask API for programmatic predictions.
   - A Streamlit app for interactive user predictions.
7. Document insights into what factors influence course popularity.
